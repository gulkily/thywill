# ThyWill - AI Assistant Project Guide

## Project Overview
**ThyWill** is a community prayer platform built with FastAPI and SQLModel. It allows users to submit prayer requests, generate proper prayers using AI (Anthropic's Claude), and track community prayer activity.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLModel ORM
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API for prayer generation
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based sessions with JWT tokens for invites

### Key Files
- `app.py` (533 lines) - Main application with all routes and business logic
- `models.py` (39 lines) - Database models and schema
- `templates/` - HTML templates for UI
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (8 packages)
- `generate_token.py` - Utility for creating invite tokens

## Database Schema

### Core Models
1. **User**: Basic user profile (id, display_name, created_at)
2. **Prayer**: Prayer requests (id, author_id, text, generated_prayer, project_tag, flagged)
3. **PrayerMark**: Tracks when users pray for requests (user_id, prayer_id, created_at)
4. **Session**: User authentication sessions (id, user_id, expires_at)
5. **InviteToken**: Invitation system for new users (token, created_by_user, used, expires_at)

## Key Features

### Prayer System
- Users submit prayer requests as prompts
- Claude AI transforms prompts into proper community prayers
- Prayers are written in third person so others can pray FOR the requester
- Community members can mark prayers as "prayed"
- Multiple feed views: all, new/unprayed, most prayed, my prayers, my requests

### Authentication & Access
- Invite-only system (requires valid invite token to join)
- First user becomes admin (id = "admin")
- Cookie-based sessions (14-day expiration)
- Admin can generate invite tokens and manage flagged content

### Feed Types
1. **All**: All unflagged prayers
2. **New & Unprayed**: Prayers with zero prayer marks
3. **Most Prayed**: Sorted by prayer count
4. **My Prayers**: Prayers the user has marked as prayed
5. **My Requests**: Prayers submitted by the user
6. **Recent Activity**: Prayers with marks in last 7 days

## API Endpoints

### Main Routes
- `GET /` - Main feed (supports feed_type parameter)
- `POST /` - Submit new prayer request
- `POST /pray/{prayer_id}` - Mark prayer as prayed
- `GET /activity` - View prayer activity/marks
- `GET /admin` - Admin panel (admin only)
- `POST /admin/flag/{prayer_id}` - Flag inappropriate content
- `GET /claim/{token}` - Claim invite and create account

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits `/claim/{token}` with valid invite
2. Creates account with display name
3. Gets session cookie (14-day expiration)
4. Can access main features

## Environment Variables
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_for_tokens
```

## AI Prayer Generation
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- System prompt ensures prayers are community-focused (third person)
- Transforms user requests into proper, reverent prayers
- Fallback to simple prayer format if API fails
- 2-4 sentence length, accessible to various faith backgrounds

## Development Patterns

### Session Management
- `create_session(user_id)` - Creates new session
- `current_user(request)` - Dependency injection for auth
- `is_admin(user)` - Check admin privileges

### Database Queries
- Uses SQLModel select statements with joins
- Complex aggregations for feed counts
- Proper filtering for flagged content

### Error Handling
- HTTPException for authentication failures
- Graceful fallbacks for AI generation
- Database transaction safety

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Feed Types
1. Add logic to main feed route in `app.py`
2. Update `get_feed_counts()` function
3. Add UI option in templates

### Modifying Prayer Generation
- Edit system prompt in `generate_prayer()` function
- Adjust model parameters (temperature, max_tokens)
- Test fallback behavior

### Database Changes
1. Update models in `models.py`
2. Handle migration manually (SQLite)
3. Update related queries in `app.py`

## Security Considerations
- Invite-only system prevents spam
- Admin flagging system for moderation
- Session expiration (14 days)
- Input validation for prayer content
- No direct database exposure

## Deployment Notes
- SQLite database file: `thywill.db`
- Run with: `uvicorn app:app --reload`
- Requires valid Anthropic API key
- Static files served from templates directory

## UI/UX Design Patterns

### Simplified Front Page Layout (Current)
- **Header Section**: Clean title with compact action buttons (Invite & Add Prayer)
- **Collapsible Prayer Form**: Hidden by default, toggles with JavaScript for cleaner interface
- **Compact Feed Navigation**: Smaller tabs with counts, mobile-friendly horizontal scroll
- **Subtle Daily Prompt**: Minimal amber-colored section, only shows when prompt exists
- **Prayer-Focused Content**: Main feed prominently displays prayers with clear hierarchy

### Design Principles
- **Prayer-First**: Prayer content is the primary focus, other features are secondary
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features (form, invites) are accessible but not prominent
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Horizontal scrolling navigation, stacked mobile layout
- **Clean Typography**: Clear visual hierarchy between prayers, requests, and metadata
- **Accessible Colors**: Purple/gray theme with proper contrast ratios

### Interactive Elements
- **Toggle-based Form**: JavaScript-powered show/hide for prayer submission
- **HTMX Integration**: Dynamic prayer marking without page reloads
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear states for prayed/unprayed items, hover effects
- **Responsive Navigation**: Auto-hiding scrollbars, mobile swipe hints

### Content Organization
- Generated prayers are prominently displayed in larger text
- Original requests are shown in secondary gray boxes
- Prayer statistics and actions are in footer area
- Empty states provide clear guidance for next actions

**üìù Note for AI Assistants**: This guide reflects the simplified UI changes made to prioritize prayer content while maintaining easy access to submission and invite functionality. The interface emphasizes progressive disclosure and clean design patterns.

This is a faith-focused community platform emphasizing reverence, simplicity, and meaningful prayer sharing.
