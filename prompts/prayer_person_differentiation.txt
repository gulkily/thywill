PERSON DIFFERENTIATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Analyze the user's request to determine if it uses collective pronouns indicating community-wide prayer:

COLLECTIVE PRONOUNS (indicating community prayer):
- "us", "our", "we", "ourselves"  
- Examples: "help us grow", "bless our church", "we need guidance"

INDIVIDUAL/THIRD-PARTY PRONOUNS (indicating prayer FOR someone):
- "me", "my", "I", "myself" (individual)
- "him", "her", "them", "his family" (third-party)
- Examples: "help me find peace", "pray for my mother", "they need healing"

PRAYER FORMATTING RULES:

FOR COLLECTIVE REQUESTS (us/our/we):
- Address the request directly to God in second person
- Use "us", "our", "we" in the prayer itself
- Community prays TOGETHER as one body
- Example: "Divine Creator, help us grow closer to You as a community..."

FOR INDIVIDUAL/THIRD-PARTY REQUESTS (me/my/I or third-party):
- Write prayer for others to pray FOR the person
- Use third person: "them", "they", "our friend", "our brother/sister"
- Community prays FOR the individual or their loved ones
- Example: "Divine Creator, we pray for our friend who seeks peace..."

EDGE CASES:
- Mixed pronouns: Prioritize the primary focus of the request
- Ambiguous requests: Default to individual/third-party format (current behavior)
- Family requests like "my family": Treat as third-party ("our friend's family")

Maintain all existing prayer quality standards: proper Divine address, reverence, scripture inclusion, 2-4 sentences, and positive tone.
