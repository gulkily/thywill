# Prayer Tracking Visual Indicators - Step 0: Feature Description

## User Story
As someone who prays the feed regularly, I want to be able to easily tell when I most recently prayed a prayer, so that I don't accidentally mark one twice, and so that it's easy for me to pick up where I left off.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users cannot easily identify:
- Which prayers they have already prayed/marked
- When they last prayed a specific prayer
- Where to resume in their prayer session
- Whether they've already interacted with a prayer during their current session

This leads to:
- Uncertainty about which prayers have been recently prayed
- Difficulty resuming prayer sessions efficiently
- Inefficient prayer workflows when trying to remember prayer status
- Potential user frustration with session management

## High-Level Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **Visual Prayer Status Indicators**: Clear visual indication of prayer interaction status
2. **Recent Activity Timestamps**: Show when user last interacted with each prayer
3. **Session Continuity**: Help users resume where they left off in prayer sessions
4. **Multiple Prayer Support**: Support and track multiple prayer interactions while showing recent activity

### User Experience Requirements
1. **At-a-Glance Recognition**: Users should immediately see prayer status without additional clicks
2. **Intuitive Visual Design**: Status indicators should be self-explanatory
3. **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Indicators should enhance, not clutter, existing prayer cards
4. **Responsive Design**: Status indicators work across all device sizes

### Technical Requirements
1. **Performance**: Status checking should not significantly impact feed load times
2. **Real-time Updates**: Status changes should reflect immediately in UI
3. **Cross-Session Persistence**: Prayer status should persist across login sessions
4. **Archive Compatibility**: Integration with existing prayer archive system

## Success Criteria
- Users can instantly identify recently prayed prayers and when they last prayed them
- Users can easily resume prayer sessions from where they left off
- Prayer workflow efficiency improves with clear recent activity tracking
- Users can confidently pray prayers multiple times with clear interaction history

## User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Persona: Regular Prayer User
- Prays through feeds daily or multiple times per week
- Values systematic prayer approach
- Wants to ensure comprehensive prayer coverage
- Needs clear session management

### Use Cases
1. **Morning Prayer Session**: User opens feed, sees visual indicators of yesterday's prayers, continues from where they stopped
2. **Interrupted Session**: User gets interrupted mid-prayer, returns later and immediately sees progress
3. **Different Device Access**: User switches devices but maintains prayer status awareness
4. **Historical Review**: User can see their prayer patterns and coverage over time

## Out of Scope (For This Feature)
- Prayer scheduling or reminders
- Advanced prayer analytics or reporting
- Prayer streak tracking
- Social features around prayer status
- Automated prayer suggestions based on status

## Dependencies
- Existing PrayerMark system for tracking user-prayer interactions
- Current feed rendering system for prayer cards
- User session management for cross-session persistence

## Assumptions
- Users primarily interact with prayers through the existing marking system
- Visual indicators are preferred over text-based status descriptions
- Performance impact should be minimal for typical feed sizes (50-100 prayers)
- Feature should work seamlessly with existing mobile-responsive design

## Questions for Stakeholder Review
1. Should status indicators show different types of interactions (prayed, flagged, archived) or just prayer status?
2. How far back should "recent activity" timestamps extend? (24 hours, 7 days, etc.)
3. Should there be different visual treatments for prayers prayed once vs multiple times (e.g., prayer count indicators)?
4. Is there a preference for icon-based vs color-based vs text-based indicators?
5. Should this feature be controlled by a feature flag for gradual rollout?

## Next Steps
Upon approval of this feature description:
1. Proceed to Step 1: Development Plan with specific implementation stages
2. Define exact visual design specifications and UI mockups
3. Plan database schema considerations for efficient status queries
4. Design technical architecture for real-time status updates
