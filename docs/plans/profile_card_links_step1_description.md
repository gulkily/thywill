# Step 1: Feature Description - Profile Card Interactive Links

## Feature Overview
Transform static numbers on user profile cards into interactive links that provide detailed views of the underlying data. This enhancement will improve user engagement and provide transparency into community activity metrics.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a user viewing any profile**, I want to click on the "Prayer Requests" number to see a filtered feed of that user's prayer requests, so I can understand their prayer journey and potentially pray for them.

2. **As a user viewing any profile**, I want to click on the "Times Prayed" number to see a list of prayers this user has prayed for, so I can see their community engagement and prayer activity.

3. **As a user viewing any profile**, I want to click on the "Unique Prayers" number to see a count or breakdown of how many different prayers they've prayed for, so I can understand their prayer diversity.

4. **As a user**, I want zero-count numbers (0) to remain non-clickable, so the interface feels intuitive and doesn't lead to empty pages.

### Secondary User Stories
5. **As a profile owner**, I want to see my own detailed prayer activity when clicking these links, so I can review my prayer history and engagement.

6. **As a user**, I want the linked views to respect privacy settings and community guidelines, so sensitive information remains appropriately protected.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Clickable Numbers**: Transform profile card statistics into clickable links when count > 0
2. **Prayer Requests Link**: Navigate to filtered prayer feed showing user's requests
3. **Times Prayed Link**: Show list/feed of prayers the user has marked/prayed for
4. **Unique Prayers Link**: Display count breakdown or list of distinct prayers prayed for
5. **Zero State Handling**: Keep zero-count numbers as plain text (non-clickable)

### Navigation Requirements
1. Links should open in same tab/window for seamless user experience
2. Each linked view should have clear breadcrumb or back navigation
3. URLs should be meaningful and bookmarkable
4. Page titles should reflect the specific view being displayed

### Data Display Requirements
1. **Prayer Requests View**: Show user's prayers in chronological order with standard prayer card layout
2. **Times Prayed View**: List prayers with prayer text, original author, and when user prayed for it
3. **Unique Prayers View**: Show count and optionally list distinct prayers with summary info
4. All views should include pagination for users with high activity

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Linked views should load quickly even for active users with hundreds of prayers
- Implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
- Consider caching for frequently accessed profile data

### Privacy & Security
- Respect existing privacy controls (archived prayers, flagged content, etc.)
- Only show prayers that the current user has permission to view
- Maintain existing authentication and authorization patterns

### UI/UX Consistency
- Links should visually indicate they're clickable (hover states, cursor changes)
- Maintain existing design language and styling patterns
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
- Loading states for data-heavy views

## Technical Considerations

### Database Queries
- Efficient filtering by user ID for prayer requests
- Join queries for times prayed (prayer marks by user)
- Distinct counting for unique prayers calculation
- Proper indexing to support new query patterns

### URL Structure
- `/profile/{user_id}/prayers` - User's prayer requests
- `/profile/{user_id}/prayed` - Prayers user has prayed for  
- `/profile/{user_id}/unique` - Unique prayers breakdown

### Existing Integration Points
- Profile card template modifications
- Route additions to existing profile system
- Integration with current prayer feed filtering
- Compatibility with supporter badge system
- Respect for existing admin controls and moderation

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
1. Users can successfully navigate from profile cards to detailed prayer views
2. All linked views load within 2 seconds for typical user data volumes
3. Zero visual regression in existing profile card layouts
4. Intuitive user flow with clear navigation paths

### Technical Success
1. No performance degradation on profile page load times
2. Efficient database queries with proper pagination
3. Full test coverage for new routes and functionality
4. Maintains existing privacy and security controls

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Prayer activity timeline/calendar view
- Advanced filtering options within linked views
- Export functionality for personal prayer history
- Prayer statistics and insights dashboard
- Social features like prayer buddy connections

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Current profile card system provides accurate statistics
- Existing prayer feed and filtering infrastructure can be extended
- User authentication system supports profile-specific views
- Database performance can handle additional query patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Implement pagination early, monitor query performance
- **Privacy Risk**: Extensive testing of permission controls in linked views  
- **UI Risk**: Maintain design consistency with existing patterns
- **Data Risk**: Ensure accurate counting and filtering logic
