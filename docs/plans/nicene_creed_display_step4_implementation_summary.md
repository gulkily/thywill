# Nicene Creed Display – Step 4: Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented the revised plan by creating a dedicated Nicene Creed page and wiring it into both public and authenticated navigation flows.

## Changes
- Added `/nicene-creed` route in `app_helpers/routes/public_routes.py` that renders the new `templates/nicene_creed.html` page for visitors and logged-in members alike, passing through session context when available.
- Created `templates/nicene_creed.html` with the full modern-English creed, supportive intro, and navigation actions back to the homepage and access request flow.
- Updated `templates/public_homepage.html` CTA group with a tertiary link to the Nicene Creed page and refreshed `templates/menu.html` so authenticated users can reach the creed from the in-app menu.

## Testing & Validation
- `./validate_templates.py` *(fails – existing author_id/author_username mismatches in other templates; unchanged by this work)*
- `pytest -m "unit"` *(times out after ~120 s with pre-existing failures in `tests/test_public_prayer_service.py`; suite not fully executed)*

## Follow-ups / Notes
- Consider fixing the template validation warnings to restore a clean linter run.
- Re-run the unit suite once the public prayer service failures are resolved or with additional runtime headroom to confirm there are no regressions.
