# Cryptographically Sound Ledger with Partial Archiving Plan

## Overview
Design and implement a cryptographically secure ledger system that supports partial archiving of public data while maintaining integrity, auditability, and cryptographic verification.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Cryptographic Foundation
- **Hash Chain Structure**: Each block contains hash of previous block
- **Digital Signatures**: All transactions signed with private keys
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient verification of transaction inclusion
- **Cryptographic Commitments**: Support for privacy-preserving operations

### 2. Ledger Structure
```
Block {
  header: BlockHeader
  transactions: Transaction[]
  merkle_root: Hash
  signature: Signature
}

BlockHeader {
  previous_hash: Hash
  timestamp: Timestamp
  block_number: u64
  public_data_hash: Hash
  private_data_commitment: Hash
}
```

### 3. Data Classification
- **Public Data**: Openly readable (balances, public keys, metadata)
- **Private Data**: Encrypted or committed (transaction details, private balances)
- **Archivable Data**: Historical public data eligible for compression/removal

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Ledger Engine
- Block validation and consensus
- Transaction processing
- State management
- Cryptographic verification

### 2. Archive Management System
- **Archive Policies**: Define what data can be archived and when
- **Compression Engine**: Compact historical public data
- **Integrity Preservation**: Maintain cryptographic proofs for archived data
- **Retrieval Interface**: Access archived data when needed

### 3. Cryptographic Verification Layer
- **Proof Generation**: Create inclusion/exclusion proofs
- **Batch Verification**: Efficiently verify multiple proofs
- **Archive Consistency**: Verify archived data matches original

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Ledger Infrastructure
1. Implement basic block structure and hash chain
2. Add transaction signing and verification
3. Build Merkle tree implementation for efficient proofs
4. Create basic consensus mechanism

### Phase 2: Data Classification System
1. Define public/private data boundaries
2. Implement encryption for private data
3. Add commitment schemes for privacy preservation
4. Create data access control layer

### Phase 3: Archive System
1. Design archive format and compression algorithms
2. Implement archive creation from historical blocks
3. Build proof generation for archived data
4. Create archive retrieval and verification system

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
1. Integrate archive system with core ledger
2. Optimize for performance and storage efficiency
3. Add monitoring and metrics
4. Implement recovery mechanisms

## Technical Specifications

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 or Blake3
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 or secp256k1
- **Merkle Trees**: Binary trees with configurable hash function
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for symmetric, RSA-4096 or ECC for asymmetric

### Archive Format
```
Archive {
  version: u32
  block_range: (u64, u64)
  compressed_public_data: Vec<u8>
  merkle_proofs: Vec<MerkleProof>
  integrity_hash: Hash
  timestamp: Timestamp
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Active Ledger**: Recent blocks stored in full
- **Archive Storage**: Compressed historical data with proofs
- **Index Layer**: Fast lookup for archived data
- **Replication**: Multiple archive copies for reliability

## Security Considerations

### 1. Integrity Guarantees
- All archived data must be cryptographically verifiable
- Archive creation process must be deterministic and auditable
- Tamper detection through hash chains and signatures

### 2. Privacy Protection
- Private data never stored in archives without proper encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive operations
- Access control for different data classification levels

### 3. Availability Assurance
- Archive redundancy across multiple storage systems
- Fast retrieval mechanisms for critical data
- Graceful degradation when archives are unavailable

## Performance Targets
- **Block Processing**: < 100ms per block
- **Archive Creation**: Background process, non-blocking
- **Proof Verification**: < 10ms per proof
- **Archive Retrieval**: < 1s for typical queries

## Compliance and Auditability
- Full audit trail for all archive operations
- Compliance with data retention regulations
- Support for regulatory queries and investigations
- Immutable logging of system operations

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Core cryptographic functions
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end ledger operations
3. **Security Tests**: Cryptographic attack resistance
4. **Performance Tests**: Scalability and throughput
5. **Archive Tests**: Data integrity across archive cycles

## Deployment Considerations
- **Staging Environment**: Full replica for testing
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment with monitoring
- **Backup Strategy**: Multiple archive storage locations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health and performance metrics

## Future Enhancements
- **Sharding**: Horizontal scaling across multiple ledgers
- **Advanced Privacy**: Ring signatures, homomorphic encryption
- **Cross-Chain**: Interoperability with other ledger systems
- **AI Integration**: Automated archive policy optimization
