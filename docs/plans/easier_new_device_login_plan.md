# Easier New Device Login Experience Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Multi-Device Authentication System
The platform currently has a robust multi-device authentication system with:

**Authentication States:**
- Full Authentication: Complete access to all features
- Half Authentication: Limited access while pending approval

**Current Approval Methods:**
1. Admin approval (instant)
2. Self approval (from trusted devices)
3. Peer approval (2 community members required)

**Security Features:**
- Rate limiting (3 requests/hour per user/IP)
- Device fingerprinting
- IP tracking and change detection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- 7-day request expiration

### Current User Experience Pain Points

**For New Device Login:**
1. **Complex approval process**: Users must wait for 2 peer approvals or admin approval
2. **Limited functionality while waiting**: Half-authenticated users can't submit prayers or mark prayers
3. **No self-service options**: Users can't easily approve themselves without another device
4. **Verification code dependency**: Enhanced security mode requires verification codes
5. **Long wait times**: Approval can take hours or days depending on community activity
6. **No notifications**: Users waiting for approval don't get notified when approved
7. **Device trust not persistent**: Each new device requires full approval process

## Improvement Plan

- High-trust users get reduced approval requirements
- Trust scores influence approval priority

**Benefits:**
- Rewards good community members
- Reduces friction for established users
- Maintains security for new users

#### 3.2 Mobile App with Push Notifications
**Goal**: Native mobile experience with instant notifications

**Implementation:**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) with push capabilities
- Native push notifications for approval requests
- Offline capability for viewing pending requests
- Biometric authentication support

**Benefits:**
- Better mobile user experience
- Instant approval notifications
- Offline functionality

#### 3.3 Time-Limited Auto-Approval
**Goal**: Reduce wait times for low-risk scenarios

**Implementation:**
- Auto-approve after 24 hours if no objections
- Allow community members to object/flag suspicious requests
- Admin override for immediate approval/rejection
- Risk scoring based on device/IP history

**Benefits:**
- Guaranteed approval timeframe
- Community-driven security oversight
- Balances security with usability

### Phase 4: Advanced Security (High Effort, Medium Impact)

#### 4.1 Hardware Security Key Support
**Goal**: Provide strongest authentication option

**Implementation:**
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 support for hardware keys
- Allow hardware keys as primary authentication
- Backup methods for when keys unavailable
- Admin-configurable security requirements

**Benefits:**
- Highest security for sensitive users
