# Orphaned Prayers Fix - Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

Prayers exist in the database but are not displayed in any feeds, making them effectively invisible to users. Based on codebase analysis, the primary cause is **religious preference mismatch** where prayers have `target_audience = "christians_only"` but no users have `religious_preference = "christian"`.

## Current Status

### Identified Orphaning Conditions
1. **Religious Preference Mismatch (ACTIVE)**: 2 prayers with `target_audience = "christians_only"` but 0 Christian users
2. **Flagged Prayers**: Completely hidden from all feeds (currently 0 flagged prayers)  
3. **Archived Prayers**: Hidden from public feeds (correctly working - 6 archived prayers)

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Primary Issue**: Religious filtering system in `app_helpers/routes/prayer/feed_operations.py:63-69`
- **Filter Logic**: Non-Christian users only see `target_audience = "all"` prayers
- **Missing Validation**: No checks to ensure prayers have compatible viewers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Emergency Recovery)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

#### 1.1 Orphaned Prayer Recovery Command
Create CLI command to identify and fix orphaned prayers:

```bash
./thywill heal-orphaned-prayers
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `heal_orphaned_prayers()` function to CLI
- Query for prayers with no compatible viewers
- Provide options:
  - Create default Christian user to view orphaned prayers
  - Generate invites for Christian users
  - Flag orphaned prayers for admin review
  - Generate detailed report of orphaned prayers

#### 1.2 Database Analysis Tool
Add diagnostic command:

```bash
./thywill analyze-orphaned-prayers
```

**Features:**
- Count prayers by `target_audience`
- Count users by `religious_preference` 
- Identify mismatches
- Generate detailed report

### Phase 2: Prevention System (Long-term Solution)
**Priority: HIGH**

#### 2.1 Prayer Visibility Validation
**File:** `app_helpers/services/prayer_helpers.py`

Add validation before prayer creation:
```python
def validate_prayer_visibility(target_audience: str, session: Session) -> bool:
    """Ensure prayer will have compatible viewers"""
    if target_audience == "christians_only":
        christian_users = session.exec(
            select(User).where(User.religious_preference == "christian")
        ).first()
        return christian_users is not None
    return True
```

#### 2.2 Prayer Creation Safeguards
**File:** `app_helpers/routes/prayer/prayer_operations.py`

Modify prayer creation to:
- Validate target audience compatibility
- Warn users if no compatible viewers exist
- Suggest alternative audience settings
- Log potential orphaning events

#### 2.3 Admin Dashboard Enhancements
**File:** `templates/admin.html`

Add orphaned prayer monitoring:
- Count of potentially orphaned prayers
- Religious preference distribution
- Target audience statistics
- Quick fix actions

### Phase 3: Automated Detection & Healing
**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### 3.1 Automated Orphaning Detection & Healing
**File:** `app_helpers/utils/orphaned_prayer_detector.py`

Create background service to:
- Run periodic orphaning checks
- Automatically heal orphaned prayers
- Alert admins of healing actions taken
- Generate weekly reports with healing statistics

#### 3.2 Automated Healing Strategies
**File:** `app_helpers/utils/orphaned_prayer_healer.py`

Implement smart healing logic:
- Create default Christian user when `"christians_only"` prayers are orphaned
- Automatically invite Christian users to ensure prayer visibility
- Flag orphaned prayers for admin review instead of changing them
- Maintain healing audit trail with detailed reasoning

#### 3.3 Enhanced Logging
**File:** `app_helpers/services/prayer_helpers.py`

Add logging for:
- Prayer creation with target audience
- User religious preference changes
- Automatic healing actions performed
- Healing success/failure events

#### 3.4 Database Maintenance Tasks
**File:** `thywill` CLI script

Add maintenance commands:
- `./thywill check-orphaned-prayers` - Quick health check
- `./thywill heal-orphaned-prayers --auto` - Enable automatic healing
- `./thywill healing-report` - View automatic healing history
- `./thywill religious-preference-report` - Demographics analysis

### Phase 4: System Improvements
**Priority: LOW**

#### 4.1 Smart Target Audience Suggestions
**File:** `templates/prayer_form.html`

Enhance prayer submission form:
- Show user counts by religious preference
- Suggest optimal target audience
- Warning messages for potential orphaning
- Real-time compatibility checking

#### 4.2 Flexible Religious Filtering
**File:** `app_helpers/routes/prayer/feed_operations.py`

Improve filtering logic:
- Fallback to "all" if no religious-specific content
- Configurable filtering behavior
- User preference for strict vs. inclusive filtering

#### 4.3 Migration & Cleanup Tools
**File:** `app_helpers/utils/prayer_migration.py`

Create tools for:
- Converting orphaned prayers to compatible audiences
- Merging duplicate flagging systems (boolean + attribute)
- Historical data cleanup
- Batch prayer audience updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries for Orphaned Detection

```sql
-- Find prayers with no compatible viewers
SELECT p.id, p.target_audience, p.created_at, p.request_text
FROM prayers p
WHERE p.target_audience = 'christians_only'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users u 
    WHERE u.religious_preference = 'christian'
  )
  AND p.flagged = FALSE
  AND p.id NOT IN (
    SELECT prayer_id FROM prayer_attributes 
    WHERE attribute_name IN ('archived', 'flagged')
  );
```

### Religious Preference Distribution Query

```sql
-- Analyze user distribution by religious preference
SELECT 
  religious_preference,
  COUNT(*) as user_count,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as percentage
FROM users 
GROUP BY religious_preference;
```

### Prayer Audience Analysis Query

```sql
-- Analyze prayer distribution by target audience
SELECT 
  target_audience,
  COUNT(*) as prayer_count,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as percentage
FROM prayers 
WHERE flagged = FALSE
  AND id NOT IN (
    SELECT prayer_id FROM prayer_attributes 
    WHERE attribute_name = 'archived'
  )
GROUP BY target_audience;
```
