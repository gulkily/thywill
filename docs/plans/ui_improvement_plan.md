# UI Improvement Plan - Carbon Design System Inspiration

## Overview
Plan to improve ThyWill's appearance using CSS techniques without introducing new frameworks, drawing inspiration from IBM Carbon Design System principles.

## Current State Analysis
- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS (CDN-based)
- **Theme**: Light/dark mode support with purple branding
- **Components**: Basic styling with custom CSS for archive functionality
- **Icons**: Custom SVG logo with animated elements
- **Layout**: Clean, centered layout with max-width containers

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Color Palette Refinement
- Create more cohesive color schemes inspired by Carbon's design tokens
- Improve contrast ratios for better accessibility
- Refine purple brand colors with complementary palette
- Enhance dark mode color consistency

### 2. Typography Hierarchy
- Better spacing, sizing, and weight distribution
- Improve readability with consistent line heights
- Establish clear heading hierarchy
- Optimize font scaling for different screen sizes

### 3. Component Styling Enhancement
- **Cards**: Better shadows, borders, and spacing
- **Buttons**: Consistent sizing, states, and hover effects
- **Forms**: Improved input styling and validation states
- **Navigation**: Enhanced header and menu styling

### 4. Subtle Animations
- Smooth transitions for theme switching
- Micro-interactions for buttons and cards
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Hover effects for interactive elements

### 5. Layout Consistency
- Better grid systems and spacing patterns
- Consistent margins and padding
- Improved responsive design
- Enhanced visual hierarchy

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Color palette and typography improvements
2. **Phase 2**: Component styling enhancements
3. **Phase 3**: Animation and interaction improvements
4. **Phase 4**: Layout and spacing refinements

## Files to Modify
- `templates/base.html` - Core styling and theme management
- `static/css/archive.css` - Existing component styles
- Create new CSS files as needed for specific improvements

## Design Principles (Carbon-Inspired)
- **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and readable content
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined interactions and fast loading
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across components
- **Beauty**: Thoughtful use of color, typography, and spacing

## Next Steps
- Choose specific improvement area to focus on first
- Create detailed implementation plan for selected area
- Begin with small, incremental changes
- Test changes across light/dark themes
