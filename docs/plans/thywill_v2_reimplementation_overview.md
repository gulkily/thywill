# ThyWill v2: Complete Reimplementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on our experience with the current ThyWill implementation, we've identified critical architectural and technical debt issues that warrant a complete rewrite. This document outlines a comprehensive plan for ThyWill v2, addressing the core problems while preserving the essential spiritual community features.

## Current System Issues

### Critical Problems Identified

1. **Database Corruption & ORM Inconsistencies**
   - SQLModel/SQLAlchemy hybrid approach causing data integrity issues
   - Inconsistent query results between different session contexts
   - Impossible-to-delete corrupted user records
   - Session validation failures due to orphaned records

2. **Authentication System Complexity**
   - Multi-device authentication adds unnecessary complexity
   - Admin token flow has multiple failure points
   - Invite tree structure prone to corruption
   - Role-based permissions incomplete and fragmented

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Monolithic app.py with business logic mixed with routes
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Direct SQLAlchemy imports bypassing SQLModel abstractions
   - Archive-first approach adds complexity without clear benefits

4. **Development Experience Issues**
   - Difficult to debug database-related problems
   - Inconsistent test coverage
   - Production/development mode switching fragile
   - CLI commands mixed with web application logic

## ThyWill v2 Goals

### Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Choose simple, well-understood patterns over complex abstractions
2. **Data Integrity**: Bulletproof database layer with consistent behavior
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and testable components
4. **Faith-Focused**: Preserve the spiritual mission while improving technical foundation
5. **Community-Driven**: Maintain invite-based growth and content moderation features

### Success Criteria

- **Zero database corruption**: Consistent data layer behavior
- **Simple authentication**: Straightforward login/admin flows
- **Fast development**: Easy to add features and fix bugs
- **Reliable operation**: No mysterious failures or edge cases
- **Clear architecture**: Easy for new developers to understand

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Changes

**Database Layer**:
- **Remove**: SQLModel hybrid approach
- **Replace with**: Pure SQLAlchemy Core + Alembic migrations
- **Rationale**: Avoid ORM complexity, explicit control over queries

**Web Framework**:
- **Keep**: FastAPI (solid choice, good performance)
- **Improve**: Better structure with dependency injection

**Authentication**:
- **Remove**: Multi-device approval system
- **Simplify**: Traditional username/password + admin tokens
- **Add**: Proper session management with secure cookies

**Data Architecture**:
- **Keep**: Text archive system (essential for transparency and recovery)
- **Improve**: Reliable database-first with robust text archive integration
- **Rationale**: Text archives provide community transparency and ultimate data durability

### Key Architectural Changes

1. **Layered Architecture**
   ```
   Web Layer (FastAPI routes)
   ↓
   Service Layer (business logic)
   ↓
   Repository Layer (database access)
   ↓
   Database Layer (SQLAlchemy Core)
   ```

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Routes handle HTTP concerns only
   - Services contain business logic
   - Repositories handle database operations
   - Models are simple data containers

3. **Explicit Dependency Management**
   - Use FastAPI's dependency injection properly
   - Clear database session lifecycle
   - Testable components with mock-friendly interfaces

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up new project structure
- Implement database layer with SQLAlchemy Core
- Create basic user and prayer models
- Set up Alembic migrations
- Implement repository pattern

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- User registration and authentication
- Prayer request submission and display
- Basic prayer marking functionality
- Admin user management
- Simple invite system

### Phase 3: Community Features (Week 5-6)
- Prayer feeds and filtering
- Content flagging system
- User profiles and preferences
- AI prayer generation integration
- Community moderation tools

### Phase 4: Polish & Migration (Week 7-8)
- Data migration from v1
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation
- Deployment automation

## Risk Mitigation

### Development Risks
- **Timeline pressure**: Build incrementally, deploy early versions
- **Feature creep**: Strict scope control, focus on core functionality
- **Team coordination**: Clear documentation and communication

### Technical Risks
- **Data migration**: Comprehensive testing with production data copies
- **Performance**: Load testing with realistic data volumes
- **Security**: Security review of authentication and data access

### Business Risks
- **User disruption**: Maintain v1 during development, smooth migration
- **Feature parity**: Document all current features, prioritize critical ones
- **Community impact**: Communicate changes clearly, gather feedback

## Timeline & Milestones

**Month 1**: Foundation and core features
**Month 2**: Community features and polish
**Month 3**: Migration and deployment

Key milestones:
- Week 2: Database layer complete and tested
- Week 4: Core prayer functionality working
- Week 6: Feature parity with v1 core functions
- Week 8: Production deployment ready

## Success Metrics

**Technical**:
- Zero database corruption incidents
- < 100ms average response time
- 99.9% uptime
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

**User Experience**:
- Simplified admin setup (< 5 minutes)
- Fast prayer submission (< 2 seconds)
- Reliable login flow (zero mysterious failures)
- Clear error messages and feedback

**Developer Experience**:
- New developer onboarding (< 1 hour)
- Feature development velocity increase
- Bug resolution time decrease
- Maintainable, documented codebase
