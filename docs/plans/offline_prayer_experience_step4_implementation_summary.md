# Offline Prayer Experience – Step 4 Implementation Summary

## Completed stages
1. **Service worker & manifest foundation** – Added installable PWA shell with manifest, root-scoped service worker, and precache list.
2. **IndexedDB bootstrapping for offline data** – Captured feed snapshots/category options into IndexedDB with offline hydration helpers.
3. **Offline prayer mark queue & background sync** – Introduced IndexedDB-backed mark queue, HTMX interception, Background Sync, and timestamp-preserving API updates.
4. **Connectivity status UI & telemetry** – Surfaced offline/queue banner messaging and stored lightweight local telemetry for sync outcomes.
5. **Hardening & rollout checks** – Wrapped features behind `OFFLINE_PWA_ENABLED`, documented env flag, and initialized pytest run (fails on existing missing tables).

## Tests executed
- `pytest -m "unit"` *(fails: existing SQLite fixture missing `user` table – see tests/test_public_prayer_service.py)*
- `pytest tests/test_public_prayer_service.py::test_is_prayer_public_eligible -q` *(fails with same missing table issue)*

## Follow-ups & risks
- Resolve underlying SQLite fixture/migration issue so unit suite can complete.
- Manual PWA sanity test (install prompt, offline cache) recommended in browser.
- Monitor LocalStorage telemetry growth; currently capped to last 50 events but consider periodic cleanup UI.
- Confirm feature flag defaults per environment before promotion.
