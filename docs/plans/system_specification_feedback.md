# SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md Feedback
## Review Date: August 9, 2025

This document provides feedback on the SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md file, identifying missing details and areas for improvement.

## Missing Critical Details

### Performance Specifications
- No response time requirements (e.g., prayer submission should complete in <2s)
- No concurrent user capacity specifications
- Missing AI API timeout/retry policies

### Error Handling Specifics
- No error code definitions or standardized error responses
- Missing specific fallback behaviors when AI service is unavailable
- No circuit breaker specifications for external dependencies

### File System Requirements
- Archive file permissions and ownership specifications
- File locking mechanisms for concurrent archive operations
- Archive corruption detection and recovery procedures

### Monitoring & Observability
- No health check endpoint specifications
- Missing metrics definitions (what to track)
- No alerting thresholds or escalation procedures

## Missing Implementation Details

### Database Specifications
- No connection pool sizing recommendations
- Missing database backup/restore procedures
- No index optimization guidelines
- Missing data retention policies (when to purge old data)

### Security Deep Dive
- No password policy requirements (since it's invite-only)
- Missing HTTPS/TLS configuration requirements
- No specific vulnerability scanning requirements
- Missing security headers specifications

### API Contract Details
- No request/response payload size limits
- Missing HTTP status code specifications for each endpoint
- No API versioning strategy
- Missing rate limit response headers

## Areas Needing Clarification

### Archive System
- How to handle concurrent archive writes (file locking)
- Archive consistency verification procedures
- Recovery procedures when archives and database diverge

### Multi-Device Authentication
- Specific device fingerprinting algorithm details
- Geographic consistency check implementation
- Token entropy requirements

### AI Integration
- Prompt versioning and management strategy
- AI response quality validation procedures
- Cost control and usage monitoring

## Recommended Additions

### Operational Procedures
- Disaster recovery procedures
- System maintenance windows and procedures
- User support escalation procedures

### Development Guidelines
- Code review requirements
- Testing coverage minimums
- Deployment validation checklist

## Overall Assessment

The document is very thorough and provides an excellent foundation for system implementation. However, these missing details would be crucial for a complete production-ready implementation. The specification covers the architectural vision well but needs more operational and implementation specifics.

## Priority Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Add performance specifications and error handling details
2. **Medium Priority**: Define monitoring requirements and security specifications
3. **Low Priority**: Add operational procedures and development guidelines

The document serves as an excellent starting point but would benefit from these additional implementation details for production deployment.
