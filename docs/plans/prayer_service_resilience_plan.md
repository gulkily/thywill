# Prayer Service Resilience Improvement Plan

## Problem Statement
During Claude API downtime, the prayer generation service falls back to a basic template that prepends user input with "Divine Creator, we lift up our friend who asks for: ". This provides a poor user experience and doesn't meet the quality standards users expect.

## Current Fallback Mechanism
Located in `app_helpers/services/prayer_helpers.py:270`:
```python
return f"Divine Creator, we lift up our friend who asks for help with: {prompt}. May your will be done in their life. Amen."
```

## Improvement Plans

### 1. User-Facing Service Status Notifications ‚≠ê (Priority Implementation)
- Add banner/notification when using fallback prayers: *"We're experiencing temporary service issues. Using simplified prayer generation."*
- Consider status indicator on prayer generation page
- Add retry mechanism with user feedback
- Implementation locations:
  - `templates/components/prayer_card.html`
  - `app_helpers/routes/prayer/prayer_crud.py`
  - `app_helpers/services/prayer_helpers.py`

### 2. Multi-Provider Fallback System
- **OpenAI GPT-4** as primary fallback (similar quality to Claude)
- **Google Gemini** as secondary fallback  
- **Local/template-based** as final fallback
- Implementation approach:
```python
def generate_prayer_with_fallbacks(prompt):
    providers = ['anthropic', 'openai', 'google']
    for provider in providers:
        try:
            return generate_prayer_with_provider(prompt, provider)
        except Exception as e:
            log_provider_failure(provider, e)
            continue
    
    # Final fallback with better templates
    return generate_template_prayer(prompt)
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation Strategies
- **Enhanced fallback templates** with better variety
- **Progressive degradation**: Try multiple providers before falling back to templates
- **Queue system**: Store failed requests to retry when service recovers

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting
- Track API failure rates
- Alert when fallback prayers are being used
- Monitor provider health status
- Log service degradation events

## Implementation Priority
1. **User-facing notifications** (immediate impact, low complexity)
2. **Multi-provider fallback** (high impact, medium complexity)
3. **Enhanced monitoring** (operational improvement)
4. **Queue/retry system** (advanced resilience)

## Files to Modify
- `app_helpers/services/prayer_helpers.py` - Core generation logic
- `app_helpers/routes/prayer/prayer_crud.py` - API endpoints
- `templates/components/prayer_card.html` - UI notifications
- `requirements.txt` - Additional API dependencies
- `deployment/sample.env` - Additional API keys

## Success Metrics
- Reduced user confusion during service outages
- Maintained prayer generation quality during provider issues
- Faster recovery from service disruptions
- Better operational visibility into service health
