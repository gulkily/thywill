# Persistent Changelog Entries - Solution Assessment

## Problem Statement
Current changelog system generates AI descriptions dynamically per server, causing inconsistency across environments and losing production-curated entries.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Static JSON Files in Repository
**Approach**: Store changelog entries as JSON files in `changelog/` directory, indexed by commit hash
- **Pros**: Simple structure, easy parsing, version controlled, supports metadata
- **Cons**: Manual file creation, potential merge conflicts, requires tooling for management
- **Files**: `changelog/entries/{commit_hash}.json` with description, type, date

### Option 2: Markdown Files with YAML Frontmatter  
**Approach**: Store entries as markdown files with structured metadata header
- **Pros**: Human-readable, supports rich formatting, familiar to developers, easy editing
- **Cons**: More complex parsing, larger file size, potential formatting inconsistencies
- **Files**: `changelog/entries/{commit_hash}.md` with YAML frontmatter + markdown body

### Option 3: Hybrid Database + Repository Backup
**Approach**: Keep current database system but add export/import for repository storage
- **Pros**: Preserves existing functionality, gradual migration, backup safety
- **Cons**: Complexity of dual systems, potential sync issues, doesn't solve core problem
- **Files**: `changelog/backup.json` exported from database

### Option 4: Single YAML Registry File
**Approach**: All changelog entries in one `changelog.yaml` file with structured entries
- **Pros**: Single source of truth, easy overview, simple deployment, no merge complexity
- **Cons**: Large file growth, potential conflicts on concurrent edits, harder partial updates
- **Files**: `changelog/changelog.yaml` with array of entry objects

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Static JSON Files)
- Provides clean separation of concerns (one file per commit)
- Minimizes merge conflicts compared to single-file approaches  
- Simple structure enables easy tooling development
- Maintains metadata capabilities while staying lightweight
- Clear migration path from existing database entries
