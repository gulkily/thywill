# OpenAI Backend Support - Step 4 Implementation Summary

## Implementation Highlights
- Added AI provider config scaffolding with validation, CLI status reporting, and tests for env handling.
- Refactored prayer generation to load providers via `app_helpers/services/ai_providers/`, moved Anthropic logic into a dedicated driver, and introduced structured results/error handling.
- Implemented OpenAI driver using the official Python SDK (responses API), added dependency hooks, and expanded unit coverage for provider behaviors.
- Updated logging to record provider usage/failures, refreshed `.env.example`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AI_PROJECT_GUIDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and CLI `config` output to reflect dual-provider support.

## Testing
- `pytest tests/unit/test_prayer_helpers.py`
- `pytest tests/test_ai_provider_config.py`
- `pytest tests/test_openai_prayer_provider.py`

## Follow-Ups
- Consider feature-flag or runtime switch to allow per-request provider overrides if ops wants automated fallback.
- Monitor production logs after deploying to ensure provider selection metrics surface as expected.
