# ThyWill Stop Command - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a safe shutdown pathway for the development server by adding a `./thywill stop` command to the CLI. The command relies on a PID file created when the dev server starts and falls back to process discovery scoped to the ThyWill project directory.

## Key Changes
- Added `cmd_stop` handler in `thywill` with PID file cleanup, targeted process detection, and graceful signal handling.
- Updated `cmd_start` to prevent duplicate launches, write the inherited PID to `.thywill_dev_server.pid`, and guide developers to use the new stop command.
- Extended CLI help output alongside documentation (`README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AI_PROJECT_GUIDE.md`) to cover the stop workflow.

## Testing
- `bash -n thywill`
- `./thywill help | head -n 40`
- `./thywill stop` (twice: once to clean stale PID file, once to confirm no-process messaging)

## Follow-ups
- Encourage future shellcheck coverage for CLI script once existing baseline issues are resolved.
