# Public Homepage Prayers - Feature Description

## Problem Statement
Non-members visiting ThyWill have no visibility into the community's prayer quality, spiritual depth, or authentic faith-based support. The current main page requires authentication, creating a barrier for potential members to understand the community's value before requesting access.

## User Stories

### Primary Users
**As a potential member (non-authenticated visitor)**, I want to:
- See inspiring, real prayers from the community so that I understand the spiritual depth and quality
- View authentic prayer content that demonstrates the community's faith-based approach
- Access a clear path to join the community after seeing its value
- Browse without creating any account or providing personal information
- Feel confident this is a legitimate Christian prayer community

**As a current community member**, I want:
- My prayers to potentially inspire newcomers (except flagged ones) 
- Assurance that flagged/inappropriate content never appears publicly
- My private context to remain within the trusted community (only prayer text visible)
- The public page to show authentic community prayer activity

**As a community administrator**, I want to:
- Automatic exclusion of flagged content from public display
- Simple system that doesn't require ongoing curation maintenance
- Clear boundaries between public prayer content and private member information

### Secondary Users
**As a current member's friend/family**, I want to:
- See what type of community my loved one is part of

### User Feedback Indicators

- No complaints about inappropriate public content exposure

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Community has sufficient recent prayers for meaningful public display
- Current flagging system adequately identifies inappropriate content
- Current supporter badge system provides adequate trust indicators
- Members are comfortable with automatic public sharing (excluding flagged prayers)
- Current database schema supports all required functionality

### Constraints
- **No database schema changes** - must use existing Prayer model and fields
- Must maintain existing authentication system without breaking changes
- Public page cannot expose any private member information beyond prayer text and author names
- **No ongoing admin maintenance required** - system must be fully automatic
- Implementation must not impact performance of authenticated user experience
- Must automatically filter out flagged and archived prayers

## Out of Scope
- Manual admin curation of prayers (system is fully automatic)
- Public commenting or interaction with prayers
- Email signup or newsletter features for public visitors
- Social media sharing functionality
- Analytics tracking of individual public visitors
- Multi-language support for public content

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Privacy breach**: Accidentally exposing private prayers or member information
  - *Mitigation*: Automatic filtering logic, comprehensive testing, only prayer text and author names exposed

### Medium Risk  
- **Content quality**: Occasional lower-quality prayers appearing publicly
  - *Mitigation*: Automatic filtering, community self-regulation through flagging system

### Low Risk
- **Performance impact**: Public traffic affecting member experience
  - *Mitigation*: Caching, optimized queries, monitoring

## Dependencies
- Current Prayer model with `flagged` field for automatic filtering
- Current supporter badge and username display systems
- Existing prayer query functions for filtering flagged/archived content
