# Offline Prayer Experience â€“ Step 2 Feature Description

## Problem
Travelers regularly lose connectivity and need Thywill to load, browse, and track their prayer activity offline while ensuring everything syncs accurately once they reconnect.

## User stories
- As a traveler, I want the app shell to load offline so that I can reach my prayers even without a network connection.
- As a traveler, I want to browse all prayer categories offline so that I can continue guided prayer sessions on the go.
- As a traveler, I want to record prayer marks offline so that my progress stays consistent during travel.
- As a traveler, I want my offline activity to persist locally until it can sync so that nothing is lost if I close the browser.
- As a traveler, I want prayer marks to keep their original timestamps when synced so that my history remains accurate.
- As a traveler, I want to see my prayed marks reflected while still offline so that the interface matches my current progress.

## Core requirements
- Service worker-managed PWA shell that precaches essential HTML, CSS, JS, icons, and category data for offline bootstrap.
- Cached read model for prayer categories and recent prayers that updates when online and remains available offline.
- IndexedDB-backed queue that stores offline prayer marks (with timestamps and metadata) until synchronization succeeds.
- Sync orchestrator that retries queued actions, reconciles conflicts, and preserves original prayer mark timestamps.
- Visual status indicators that show offline/online state, surface queued mark counts, and warn about unsynced activity.

## User flow
1. User installs or loads the app while online; service worker precaches assets and seeds IndexedDB with categories/prayers.
2. User loses connectivity but opens Thywill; cached app shell renders and loads data from IndexedDB.
3. User browses prayer categories and details using offline data sourced from IndexedDB.
4. User marks prayers as completed; entries are saved to the offline queue with actual timestamps.
5. When connectivity returns, the sync orchestrator flushes queued marks to the server, confirms success, and clears indicators.

## Success criteria
- App shell, navigation menu, and prayer category list load within 2 seconds while in airplane mode after an initial online visit.
- 100% of offline prayer marks sync to the server within 60 seconds of restored connectivity without losing timestamps.
- QA walkthrough verifies offline/online status messaging, shows queued marks reflected while offline, and confirms no data loss after closing and reopening the browser offline.
