# Admin Rights Management - Feature Description (Step 1)

## Feature Overview
Web interface functionality for existing admins to grant admin privileges to other users through a simple, secure interface.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As an admin**, I want to grant admin rights to existing users through the web interface, so that I can manage administrative access without requiring command-line access or database manipulation.

### Supporting User Stories
- **As an admin**, I want to see a list of current non-admin users, so that I can easily select who to promote
- **As an admin**, I want confirmation before granting admin rights, so that I don't accidentally promote the wrong user
- **As an admin**, I want to see which users are already admins, so that I have visibility into current administrative access
- **As a regular user**, I want my admin status change to be immediate, so that I can start using admin features right away

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Admin-only access**: Only existing admins can access the admin rights management interface
2. **User selection**: Display list of existing non-admin users with their display names
3. **Promotion action**: Simple one-click promotion with confirmation dialog
4. **Immediate effect**: Admin rights take effect immediately without requiring logout/login
5. **Current admin visibility**: Show list of current admins for reference
6. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate into existing admin interface/menu structure

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Minimal development effort**: Reuse existing patterns, auth, and UI components
2. **No breaking changes**: Must not affect existing functionality or user experience
3. **Security**: Maintain existing security model and audit logging patterns
4. **Performance**: Lightweight interface with minimal database queries
5. **Mobile friendly**: Work on existing responsive design

### Technical Constraints
1. Use existing auth system (`is_admin()`, `require_full_auth()`)
2. Leverage existing HTMX patterns for UI interactions
3. Follow existing route and template naming conventions
4. Use existing database models (User, UserRole if exists)
5. Integrate with existing admin menu/navigation

## Success Criteria
1. Admin can promote any existing user to admin status in under 30 seconds
2. No additional authentication or complex workflows required
3. Change is immediately visible in user's interface
4. Zero impact on existing users or functionality
5. Interface follows existing admin UI patterns and styling

## Out of Scope
- Removing admin rights (demotion)
- Role-based permissions beyond admin/non-admin
- Bulk admin promotion
- Email notifications or approval workflows
- User registration or invitation management
- Complex permission management

## Business Value
- Reduces administrative overhead for user management
- Eliminates need for command-line or database access for admin promotion
- Provides immediate admin access for new administrators
- Maintains security while improving usability

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk**: Leverages existing authentication, follows established patterns, minimal code changes required.
