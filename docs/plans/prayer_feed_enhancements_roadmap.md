### Technical Considerations

#### Database Design
- Use JSON fields for flexible preference storage
- Index frequently queried preference keys
- Implement preference versioning for migrations

#### Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed preferences
- Lazy load non-critical preference UI
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic theming

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for preference logic
- Integration tests for cross-device sync
- User acceptance testing for UI/UX changes
- Performance testing for feed loading
