# Membership Application - Feature Description

## Problem Statement
Non-registered users who view public prayers have no direct path to request community membership, creating friction between interest and access. Currently, potential members must find existing members to request invite links, creating a barrier to community growth.

- Review membership applications with applicant context (username, motivation)
- See applicant information in an organized, reviewable format
