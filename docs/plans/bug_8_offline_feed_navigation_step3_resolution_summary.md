# Bug 8 – Offline Feed Navigation Step 3 Resolution Summary

## Fix Overview
- Updated the service worker’s navigation fallback to prefer exact cached responses before falling back to the root shell, preserving previously visited feeds offline.
- Exposed `ThywillOffline.hasFeedSnapshot` so the client can detect whether a feed snapshot exists in IndexedDB.
- Added metadata to navigation pills and rendered all feed headings in hidden blocks, enabling client-side toggling without a round trip.
- Implemented an offline navigation script that intercepts feed clicks, hydrates the requested feed from cached data, updates headings/nav state, and surfaces a graceful message when no offline snapshot exists.

## Tests Run
- `./validate_templates.py` *(fails on pre-existing author_id references in unrelated templates)*
- ✔️ Manual inspection pending (run Chrome offline test switching feeds to confirm UI updates and fallback message).

## Follow-ups
- Perform end-to-end manual verification in browser (offline → switch among all feeds → reconnect).
- Consider prefetching/storing feed headings alongside list HTML to better handle never-before-visited feeds.
- Address outstanding template validation errors unrelated to this bug.
