# Admin Statistics Dashboard - Feature Description

## Problem
Admins and community members lack visibility into site activity patterns and growth metrics, making it difficult to understand community health and engagement trends.

## User Stories

**As an admin**, I want to see prayer activity by time period so that I can understand usage patterns and community growth.

**As an admin**, I want to view user engagement statistics so that I can identify active community members and growth trends.

**As an admin**, I want to see prayer lifecycle metrics so that I can understand how prayers progress through their journey.

**As a community member**, I want to see aggregate community statistics so that I can understand the scope and impact of our prayer community.

**As an admin**, I want to export statistics data so that I can create reports and analyze trends over time.

## Core Requirements

- Display prayer counts by time period (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Provide community-wide aggregate statistics

2. User selects time period and metric type from interface
3. System displays interactive charts and summary statistics  
4. User can drill down into specific time periods or metrics

## Success Criteria

- Statistics load within 2 seconds for standard time ranges
- Data accuracy verified against database queries
- Both admin and community member access levels implemented
- UI integrates seamlessly with existing admin panel design
- Performance remains acceptable with large datasets (>1000 prayers)
