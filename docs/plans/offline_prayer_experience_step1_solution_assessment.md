# Offline Prayer Experience – Solution Assessment

**Problem**: Deliver a prayer experience that works offline while keeping data consistent once the user reconnects.

**Option A – PWA app shell with service worker + IndexedDB queue**
- Pros: Full offline-first UX, precaches UI/assets, resilient data queue with Background Sync, scalable to other features.
- Cons: Highest complexity, requires new build pipeline pieces (manifest, service worker management), careful cache invalidation.

**Option B – Lightweight offline mode using navigator.onLine + LocalStorage snapshots**
- Pros: Minimal infrastructure changes, relies on existing LocalStorage patterns, faster to prototype.
- Cons: Limited offline boot (needs first online load), risk of stale data, manual reconciliation logic for queued actions.

**Option C – Service worker for asset caching + API fallback stubs, but queue in LocalStorage**
- Pros: Guarantees offline boot via cached shell, keeps data layer simpler than IndexedDB, incremental path from current code.
- Cons: Still adds service worker complexity, LocalStorage less reliable for large datasets, manual sync code needed.

**Recommendation**: Option A. The full PWA approach best matches the offline-first user stories, giving us a scalable service-worker-managed app shell plus an IndexedDB-backed queue that can timestamp prayer marks accurately and sync reliably once online.
