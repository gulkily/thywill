# Nicene Creed Display – Step 2: Feature Description

## Problem
Visitors and signed-in members have no dedicated location to read the Nicene Creed, forcing us to either crowd other pages or leave them guessing about our doctrinal foundations.

## User Stories
- As a seeker exploring the site, I want a clearly labeled Nicene Creed page so that I can quickly confirm the community's beliefs.
- As a logged-in member, I want to revisit the Nicene Creed from my main navigation so that I can reference it during prayer and discussion.
- As a site administrator, I want the Nicene Creed page available to both public visitors and authenticated users so that everyone encounters our theological grounding without friction.

## Core Requirements
- Create a dedicated Nicene Creed page with the approved modern-English text and basic context (heading, optional short intro).
- Expose the page via an intuitive link on the public homepage and within the authenticated navigation/menu so both audiences can reach it.
- Ensure the page loads without requiring authentication while remaining accessible after login (no redirect loops or permission errors).
- Maintain responsive, accessible presentation for the creed text across devices and themes.

## User Flow
1. Visitor (logged out or logged in) clicks the Nicene Creed link from the homepage hero or in-app menu.
2. System serves the dedicated Nicene Creed page.
3. Visitor reads the creed; may navigate back via standard controls or pursue other calls to action.

## Success Criteria
- Nicene Creed page exists at a predictable URL (e.g., `/nicene-creed`) and is reachable regardless of authentication state.
- Public homepage and authenticated navigation both surface a link labeled “Nicene Creed”.
- Text is accurate, readable, and accessible (proper headings, contrast, link focus states).
- No regressions to existing navigation flows or layout performance budgets.
