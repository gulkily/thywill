# Landing Page Optimization Plan

## Overview
Based on the B2B landing page best practices advice, this plan outlines improvements for the "Access Required" page (`unauthorized.html`) and "Claim Invite" page (`claim.html`) to better engage prospects, reduce friction, and guide users to conversion.

## Key Principles from Landing Page Advice

### 1. Solve Visitor's Main Problem
- **Principle**: Humans have an 8-second attention span; less than a goldfish
- **Application**: Quickly address why they're on the page and what they need to do

### 2. Simplify the First Step
- **Principle**: Too many questions upfront can overwhelm B2B leads
- **Application**: Start with minimal information to ease leads in

### 3. Show, Don't Tell
- **Principle**: Make it easy to understand through visuals/animations
- **Application**: Use clear visual cues and explanatory content

### 4. Keep It Slightly Simple
- **Principle**: Clear taglines are simple and direct
- **Application**: "Made for people. Built for productivity" type messaging

## Current State Analysis

### Access Required Page (`unauthorized.html`)
**Current Issues:**
- Long explanatory text blocks that may overwhelm visitors
- Multiple information sections compete for attention
- CTA (login button) is buried among informational content
- Doesn't immediately solve the visitor's core problem: "How do I get in?"

### Claim Invite Page (`claim.html`)
**Current Issues:**
- Extensive community information before the main action
- Form is far down the page after lengthy explanations
- Multiple sections compete with the primary conversion goal
- Doesn't follow "simplify first step" principle

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Access Required Page Improvements

#### Primary Focus: Solve the Main Problem First
- **Hero Section**: Lead with clear problem statement and immediate solution
- **Headline**: "Need Access to Thy Will?" 
- **Subheading**: "Get your invite link in under 5 minutes"

#### Simplified Flow
```
1. Problem Statement (8-second attention span)
2. Primary CTA (existing member login OR get invite)
3. Secondary information (collapsible/minimal)
4. Trust indicators (security, privacy)
```

#### Content Structure
- **Above fold**: Problem + Solution + CTA
- **Below fold**: Additional context for those who need it
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear progression from problem to solution

### 2. Claim Invite Page Improvements

#### Lead with Action, Not Information
- **Hero Focus**: "Complete Your Invitation" 
- **Immediate Form**: Display name input prominently at top
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Community info available but not blocking

#### Simplified First Step
```
1. Welcome + immediate form (name only)
2. One-click join button
3. Community details as progressive disclosure
4. Guidelines as post-join information
```

#### Trust Building
- Simple privacy statement: "No email required. Join with just your name."
- Clear expectation: "Takes 30 seconds"

2. **Value Proposition Testing**

   - "No Email Required" vs "Anonymous Prayer Requests"

3. **Visual Elements**
