# Bug 9 – Feed Selector Scroll Reset Step 3 Resolution Summary

## Fix Overview
- Added `aria-current` metadata and data attributes to navigation pills, enabling consistent active-state tracking on both server and client renders.
- Persist the selector’s `scrollLeft` in `sessionStorage` before navigation and restore it on load so the active pill remains visible after each page change.
- Updated the offline navigation script to reuse the same scroll key, scrolling the active pill into view when rendering cached feeds and keeping the stored value in sync.

## Tests Run
- `./validate_templates.py` *(fails due to existing unrelated template issues with `author_id`; unchanged by this fix)*
- Manual spot check recommended: scroll to a far-right feed, select it online, confirm the selector stays positioned post-reload; repeat offline to ensure consistent behaviour.

## Follow-ups
- Execute the manual spot check and update the regression script if additional steps are useful.
- Consider an automated browser test (Playwright) to lock in selector positioning behaviour.
