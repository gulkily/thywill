# Feature: LocalStorage Session Persistence

## Problem
Modern browsers aggressively clear cookies, especially during privacy cleaning, incognito mode exits, or after periods of inactivity. Users lose their authentication sessions unexpectedly and must go through the full login/approval process again, even for devices they've used recently. This creates significant friction for legitimate users while providing minimal security benefit.

## User Stories
- As a returning user, I want my login session to persist even when my browser clears cookies so that I don't have to repeatedly request community approval for the same device
- As a frequent user, I want to stay logged in across browser restarts and privacy cleanups so that I can access the platform seamlessly
- As a community member, I want reliable access without repeatedly bothering other members for approval on devices I regularly use
- As a mobile user, I want my session to survive iOS Safari's aggressive cookie clearing so that I can access prayers on-the-go consistently
- As a privacy-conscious user, I want session persistence that works even when I clear browsing data, as long as I don't specifically clear site data

## Core Requirements
1. **LocalStorage Backup**: Automatically backup session tokens to LocalStorage when sessions are created
2. **Session Restoration**: Check LocalStorage for valid session data when cookies are missing but user accesses the site
3. **Dual Storage Sync**: Keep both cookie and LocalStorage session data in sync during normal operation
4. **Security Validation**: Verify restored sessions against database before accepting them as valid
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Fall back to normal login process if LocalStorage data is invalid or expired
6. **Cross-Tab Sync**: Ensure session changes in one tab are reflected in other tabs of the same site
7. **Privacy Compliance**: Allow users to explicitly clear all session data including LocalStorage

## User Flow
1. **Initial Login**: User logs in normally → session cookie created → session data automatically backed up to LocalStorage
2. **Cookie Loss**: User returns later, browser has cleared cookies → system checks LocalStorage for valid session data
3. **Session Restore**: If LocalStorage contains valid, unexpired session → restore session to cookies and continue seamlessly
4. **Failed Restore**: If LocalStorage data invalid/expired → user proceeds through normal login flow
5. **Logout**: User explicitly logs out → both cookies and LocalStorage are cleared
6. **Privacy Clear**: User can clear "all site data" to remove both cookies and LocalStorage persistence

## Success Criteria
- Users with cleared cookies but valid LocalStorage sessions can access the site without re-authentication
- Session restoration happens automatically and transparently to the user
- Invalid or expired LocalStorage sessions fail gracefully to normal login flow
- No security degradation - restored sessions are fully validated against database
- Works across different browsers and handles browser-specific storage limitations
- Performance impact is minimal (LocalStorage operations are fast)

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing security model - no reduction in session validation
- LocalStorage data must be encrypted/signed to prevent tampering
- Should handle LocalStorage quota limitations gracefully
- Must work with existing session management system without breaking changes
- Should preserve existing logout and session expiry functionality
