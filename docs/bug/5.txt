Infinite reload loop on specific pages: /auth/my-requests, /admin, /changelog

Steps to reproduce:

1. Log in to the application with any user account
2. Navigate to any of the following URLs:
   - /auth/my-requests
   - /admin  
   - /changelog
3. Observe page behavior upon loading

Expected:
Page should load normally and display the expected content without continuous reloading

Actual:
Page gets stuck in an infinite reload loop, continuously refreshing and never displaying stable content

Notes:
- Affects multiple distinct pages with different functionalities
- Issue occurs consistently across the affected URLs
- May be related to authentication checks, permission validation, or HTMX behavior
- Creates poor user experience and prevents access to important features
- Admin functionality is completely inaccessible due to this issue

Priority: High
Impact: Critical functionality disruption - admin panel inaccessible, authentication management unusable, changelog unavailable
Workaround: None identified - affected pages are completely unusable
