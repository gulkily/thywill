Daily Priority menu choice disappears after Prayed button is pressed.

Steps to reproduce:

0. Log in with an admin account that has daily priority choices.
1. Open the prayer feed.
2. Choose one prayer in the feed, and press the "..." button
3. Observe that there are admin choices including: Mark as Daily Priority (or Remove Daily Priority if already set)
4. Press the "I Prayed This" button on the prayer
5. Open the "..." menu again

Expected:
Prayer still has the daily priority menu choice (Mark as Daily Priority or Remove Daily Priority)

Actual:
Daily priority choice is missing from the menu

Root Cause Analysis:
The "I Prayed This" button uses HTMX to update the prayer marks section via `/mark/{prayer_id}` endpoint. This endpoint returns updated HTML that replaces the prayer marks section, which includes the dropdown menu. However, the template context used to render the updated menu may not include the `is_daily_priority` status, causing the conditional daily priority menu items to disappear.

Related Issues:
- Similar to bug #1 where Archive and Praise menu choices disappear
- Affects prayer_marks_section.html template rendering
- HTMX target: #prayer-marks-{{ p.id }}

Technical Details:
- Endpoint: POST /mark/{prayer_id} 
- HTMX Response: prayer_marks_section.html template
- Missing Context: p.is_daily_priority status in template rendering

Priority: Medium
Impact: Admin workflow disruption, requires page refresh to restore menu
Workaround: Refresh page to restore daily priority menu options
