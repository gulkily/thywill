# Bug Report #9: Feed Selector Scroll Resets After Navigation

## Summary
When browsing online, selecting a feed that sits off-screen in the horizontal selector (e.g., far to the right) causes the page to reload and the selector scroll position resets to the left, hiding the active tab.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Visit `/feed` while online.
2. Horizontally scroll the navigation pills to reveal a feed near the right end (e.g., "Praise Reports").
3. Click that feed.
4. After the page reloads, observe the selector position.

## Expected Behavior
- The feed navigation should remain scrolled so the active pill stays visible after navigation completes.

## Actual Behavior
- The selector snaps back to its initial position, hiding the active pill off-screen and forcing the user to scroll again to find it.

## Impact
- Poor usability when switching to non-primary feeds, especially on smaller screens.
- Inconsistent navigation experience between online (reload) and offline (client-side) navigation.

## Technical Notes
- Navigation triggers a full page reload. On load, the selector doesnâ€™t restore its previous `scrollLeft` value.
- Potential fix: persist the scroll position (e.g., in sessionStorage) and restore it on DOMContentLoaded, or adjust server response to mark the active pill in view.
