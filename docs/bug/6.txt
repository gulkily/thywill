# Bug Report #6: Cancel Button Behavior Issue in Prayer Edit Dialog

## Summary
The "Cancel" button in the prayer request edit dialog incorrectly dismisses the entire dialog instead of returning to the previous state, causing data loss.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Click "Add Prayer Request" 
2. Enter a prayer request and click "Preview Prayer"
3. Click "Edit Request" to modify the original request
4. Click "Cancel" in the edit dialog

## Expected Behavior
- Should return to the previous state showing the generated prayer
- User should be able to continue with the original generated prayer
- No data loss should occur

## Actual Behavior
- Entire dialog is dismissed
- All entered data (original request and generated prayer) is lost
- User must start the entire process over

## Impact
- Poor user experience
- Potential data loss
- Breaks expected UI flow patterns

## Technical Notes
- Likely related to modal/dialog state management in HTMX
- May involve incorrect event handling for cancel button
- Could be in templates related to prayer generation workflow
