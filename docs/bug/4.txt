Prayer actions dropdown menu text overflow - "Mark as Daily Priority" extends past menu boundary

Steps to reproduce:

1. Navigate to any prayer in the feed
2. Click the "..." button to open the dropdown menu
3. Observe the "Mark as Daily Priority" menu item

Expected:
All menu text should be contained within the dropdown menu boundaries with proper text wrapping or menu width adjustment

Actual:
The text "Mark as Daily Priority" extends beyond the right edge of the dropdown menu, making it partially unreadable and creating a poor user experience

Technical Details:
- The dropdown menu has insufficient width to accommodate longer menu item text
- CSS styling needs adjustment for either:
  - Increased menu width to fit longest text
  - Text wrapping for long menu items
  - Truncation with ellipsis for overflow text

Priority: Low-Medium
Impact: Visual/UX issue that affects readability but doesn't break functionality
