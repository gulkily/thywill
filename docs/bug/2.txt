Feed navigation selector not scrollable on desktop, hiding archived prayers option.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Log in as admin or user with archived prayers
2. View the main feed page on desktop/wide screen
3. Look at the feed navigation buttons at the top
4. Observe that "Archived" option may not be visible if there are many feed options

Expected:
Feed navigation should be scrollable or wrap to show all available options including "Archived"

Actual:
Feed navigation appears to be cut off on desktop, potentially hiding the "Archived" feed option

Notes:
- This affects discoverability of archived prayers
- Users may not realize they have archived content
- Mobile layout may handle this differently than desktop
