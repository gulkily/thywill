1. Open the prayer feed.
2. Choose one prayer in the feed, and press the "..." button
3. Observe that there are at least 3 choices: Add Praise, Archive, Flag
4. Press the Prayed button on the prayer
5. Open the "..." menu again

Prayer still has Add Praise, Archive, and Flag choices

Actual:
Prayer only has Flag choice
