# Enhanced User Onboarding and Error Pages Implementation Plan

## Overview
Improve the user experience for new visitors and unauthorized users by creating informative onboarding pages and better error handling.

## Current State Analysis

### A. Claim Invite Page (`templates/claim.html`)
**Current Issues:**
- Very minimal content - just "Join Thy Will" with display name input
- No explanation of what the community is about
- No context about expectations or community values
- No information about the prayer community purpose
- Doesn't set proper expectations for new users

### B. Unauthorized Error Handling (`app.py:57, 61`)
**Current Issues:**
- Uses `raise HTTPException(401)` which returns JSON response
- No user-friendly error page for unauthorized access
- Poor user experience when sessions expire or users aren't logged in
- No guidance on how to regain access

## Implementation Plan

## Part A: Enhanced Claim Invite Page

### 1. Community Introduction Section
**Content to Include:**
- Clear explanation of Thy Will as a prayer community
- Community mission and values
- What makes this community special (invite-only, faith-based, supportive)
- Biblical foundation and spiritual focus

### 2. Expectations and Guidelines
**Content to Include:**
- Community guidelines and expected behavior
- Prayer request etiquette
- Respectful interaction standards
- Confidentiality and privacy expectations
- How the community supports each other

### 3. Process Explanation
**Content to Include:**
- What happens after joining (approval process if applicable)
- How to participate in the community
- Overview of features (prayer requests, marking prayers, community)
- Multi-device authentication explanation

### 4. Design Improvements
**UI Enhancements:**
- Better visual hierarchy with sections
- Inspirational imagery or icons
- Scripture verse or spiritual quote
- More welcoming and warm design
- Progress indication (step 1 of onboarding)

## Part B: Unauthorized Error Page

### 1. Custom 401 Error Handler
**Implementation:**
- Create custom FastAPI exception handler for 401 errors
- Replace JSON responses with user-friendly HTML pages
- Handle different unauthorized scenarios appropriately

### 2. Unauthorized Page Content
**Different Scenarios to Handle:**
- **No session cookie**: New visitor needs invite link
- **Expired session**: User needs to log back in
- **Invalid session**: Session corrupted, needs re-authentication
- **Insufficient permissions**: Half-authenticated user trying to access full features

### 3. Page Design and Content
**Content Elements:**
- Clear explanation of why access was denied
- Instructions on how to regain access
- Links to appropriate next steps
- Community contact information
- Consistent branding with rest of site

## Technical Implementation

### A. Enhanced Claim Invite Page

#### 1. Update `templates/claim.html`
```html
- Add community introduction section
- Add expectations and guidelines
- Add process explanation
- Improve visual design and layout
- Add inspirational elements
```

#### 2. Consider Additional Data
- Pass community statistics to template (optional)
- Include testimonials or community highlights (optional)
- Add dynamic content based on invite source (future enhancement)

### B. Unauthorized Error Handling

#### 1. Create Exception Handler (`app.py`)
```python
from fastapi.exceptions import HTTPException
from fastapi.exception_handlers import http_exception_handler

@app.exception_handler(401)
async def unauthorized_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    # Determine unauthorized reason and redirect appropriately
    return templates.TemplateResponse("unauthorized.html", {
        "request": request,
        "reason": determine_unauthorized_reason(request),
        "return_url": request.url.path
    })
```

#### 2. Create `templates/unauthorized.html`
- Clean, informative error page
- Different content based on unauthorized reason
- Clear next steps for user
- Links to get help or new invite

#### 3. Update Current User Function
- Add more context to HTTPException for better error handling
- Pass additional information about why authentication failed
