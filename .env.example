# - Verification codes are shown in both the requesting device AND approval notifications
# - Convenient for trusted environments where users can see the code in notifications
# - Easier approval process as code is visible in the notification dropdown
#
# When true (Enhanced Security Mode):
# - Verification codes are ONLY shown on the requesting device
# - Approving users must get the code directly from the person requesting access
# - Prevents unauthorized approvals even if someone gains access to an approval device
