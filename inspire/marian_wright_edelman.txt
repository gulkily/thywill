O God,
Help us to be ever faithful gardeners of the spirit,
who know that without darkness nothing comes to birth
and without light nothing flowers.

Grant us the strength to persevere in times of trial,
the wisdom to seek justice and love mercy,
and the courage to act with compassion for all your children.

May we never be content with the world as it is,
but inspire us to dream of the world as it could beâ€”
and to work together until it comes.

Amen.
