O God, Creator of the universe,
who extends your paternal concern over every creature
and guides the events of history to the goal of salvation,
we acknowledge your fatherly love
when you break the resistance of mankind
and, in a world torn by strife and discord,
you make us ready for reconciliation.

Renew for us the wonders of your mercy;
send forth your Spirit to work in the intimacy of hearts,
that enemies may begin to dialogue,
that adversaries may shake hands
and peoples may encounter one another in harmony.

May all commit themselves to the sincere search for true peace
which will extinguish all arguments,
for charity which overcomes hatred,
for pardon which disarms revenge.

Amen.
