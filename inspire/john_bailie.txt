O God my Creator and Redeemer,
I may not go forth today except You accompany me with Your blessing.
Let not the freshness of the morning, nor the vigor of health, nor the prosperity of my undertakings,
make me forget You, O God, who are the source of all good.

Keep me from sin in thought, word, and deed.
Let me remember that all the day long,
I am in Your sight.

Give me a spirit of gratitude and contentment,
and grant that I may pass through this day with a quiet heart and a clear conscience,
ever mindful of Your presence.

Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.
